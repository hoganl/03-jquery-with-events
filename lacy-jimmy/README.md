# JQuery With Events

**Author**: Jimmy Chang and Lacy Hogan
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
  We wanted the user to be able to filter articles by author name and category. We wanted a tab based navigation so that users could easily visit other sections of the site. We wanted the users to just view the teasers of the articles to know what they are and click on read on if they want to continue reading the article.

## Getting Started
  Add a menu of authors and categories so they can choose specific articles.
  We hid parts of the site and only showed what the user wanted to see based on the tab based navigation.
  We hid parts of the article and provided a read on function so that the user could read some of the article and if they liked what they were reading they could click read on to read the rest of the article.

## Architecture
  We used jQuery, event handlers, and template literals. We also added a script tag referencing our new js file and called the functions.
